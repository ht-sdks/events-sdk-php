Releasing
=========

 1. Update [Version.php](lib/Version.php) with the version you want to release and commit the change.
 1. Create a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/ht-sdks/events-sdk-php/releases) that matches the version you just set in `lib/Version.php`.

 That's it! Composer will automatically pick up the new tag and you can see the latest version at https://packagist.org/packages/hightouchio/events-sdk-php.
